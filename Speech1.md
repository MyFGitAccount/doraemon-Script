**[SCENE START]**

**INT. BARE, SECURE GOVERNMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - 2026**

**NARRATOR**
Tokyo, 2026. A city held by bears. In a secure room, three people—Momoko, Yuki, and Kanji—face an impossible choice. One must become Doraemon and die to save Japan. They have two hours to decide.

The PRIME MINISTER, a man eroded by crisis, stands before them. Two officials flank him, one holding a plain, sealed dossier.

**PRIME MINISTER**
Master, we have no time left. The final defensive line will not hold another night. Your previous counsel was… opaque. I need clarity. You said there was a way. What is it?

**SHINTO MASTER**
(Without looking up)
You have tried the fist. You have tried the word. They have failed. The kami of the mountain are not negotiating. They are reclaiming. The bears are merely their flesh.

**PRIME MINISTER**
Then we are finished.

**SHINTO MASTER**
(His finger traces a line on the scroll)
There is one story they will still hear. An older story. From before the cities. A story of a blue herald from the stars, who leads the lost home to the untouched forest.

**PRIME MINISTER**
A children’s story? Doraemon?

**SHINTO MASTER**
The symbol does not matter. The belief does. The animal spirits believe this. Their king dreams of this herald. You must give him the herald. The form must be filled.

**PRIME MINISTER**
How? We send in an actor? A drone?

**SHINTO MASTER**
(He looks up, his eyes like dark water)
No. The vessel must be alive. It must be true. It must be born under the correct stars, at the precise turning of the last millennium. When the celestial river was aligned as it is in the story. Only then will the king recognize the scent. Only then will the bears obey.

**PRIME MINISTER**
You’re talking about a person.

**SHINTO MASTER**
I am talking about a key. You have the records. Find those born at 1:11 in the morning, on the first day of 2001. The stars have left their mark on three souls.

**PRIME MINISTER**
And if we find them? What happens to the one who goes?

**SHINTO MASTER**
They will put on the blue skin. They will walk to the king. They will speak the command. And the bears will turn and follow them north, back to the deep forests.

Bring the three here. Let them choose among themselves which key turns the lock. Their different hearts will guide them. You have two hours from the moment they meet. No more.


**PRIME MINISTER**
Thank you for coming. I will dispense with formalities. You know the situation. You know what has been asked for.

He nods to the official, who opens the dossier and lays three birth certificates on the table.

**PRIME MINISTER (CONT'D)**
Momoko Aoki. Yuki Tanaka. Kanji Hayashi. All born at 1:11 a.m., January 1st, 2001. A temporal anomaly our specialists identified as... significant. The Shinto master was insistent. The Bear King’s demand is not for just anyone. It is for one of you.

**KANJI**
Why? What does our birth time have to do with bears? With... Doraemon?

**PRIME MINISTER**
We know there's a prophecy: a chosen bear will lead them to a promised forest.
The King believes it's true. For it to work, the chosen one needs the right star-sign.
That's you three. You have the exact alignment the bears are looking for. They can smell it on you.

**MOMOKO**
So we are sacrifices chosen by astrology.

**PRIME MINISTER**
You three are our last hope for peace. Fighting and talking got us nowhere.
The only thing that’s worked is this old bear legend. They’ve agreed to leave our cities—but only if their chosen "Doraemon" leads them.
Whoever goes as Doraemon can never come back. That’s the King’s final word.


**YUKI**
And if we refuse? If no one goes?

**PRIME MINISTER**
Then the advance resumes at nightfall. The last pocket of Tokyo falls. And Japan, as a functional entity, ceases to exist.

He places a heavy, old-fashioned alarm clock on the table. He winds it, and the loud TICKING fills the sterile room.

**PRIME MINISTER (CONT'D)**
You have two hours. To talk. To decide. To... prepare. We will return for your answer.

He turns to leave, pausing at the door.

He exits. The door seals with a soft *thud* and a click of heavy locks.

**KANJI**
(Exhaling shakily)
So. This is it. We have two hours to decide which one of us… goes to the bears.

**MOMOKO**
(Quietly)
To die.

**YUKI**
Nods slowly, her eyes fixed on the bear outside.
The Prime Minister made that quite clear. One Doraemon. One sacrifice. The Bear King accepts nothing less. The Shinto master was… specific.

*[CONTINUES AS IN ORIGINAL SCRIPT...]*

**[SCENE END]**

**KANJI**
(Exhaling shakily)
So. This is it. We have two hours to decide which one of us… goes to the bears.

**MOMOKO**
(Quietly)
To die.

**YUKI**
Nods slowly, her eyes fixed on the bear outside.
The Prime Minister made that quite clear. One Doraemon. One sacrifice. The Bear King accepts nothing less. The Shinto master was… specific.

**NARRATOR**
A pause. The weight of the absurdity and the horror sits with them.

**KANJI**
It’s madness. Cosplay as a blue cartoon cat to appease a bear king? It sounds like a child’s nightmare.

**MOMOKO**
But the bears are real. And 70% of our country… gone. The world is upside down. In such times, we grasp at stories. Even old children’s stories. The master said the bears believe it. That is the reality we must navigate.

**YUKI**
The reality is, one of us must wear the costume and die. The question is *who*. And *why*. We are not just three names. We are… what we believe. They told us that. It’s why they mentioned our faiths. They expect our beliefs to guide us. Or to conflict.

**NARRATOR**
Another long silence. Kanji fidgets, his lips moving in silent prayer.

**KANJI**
I… I should go.

Momoko and Yuki look at him, surprised.

**MOMOKO**
Why, Kanji?

**KANJI**
Because it is Ramadan. Well, it was. It ended last week. But… the spirit remains. Fasting, yes, but more than that. It is about self-discipline, sacrifice, and empathy for those who suffer. For thirty days, we abstain to draw closer to God, to purify ourselves, to remember the needy. Now… look outside. All of Japan is needy. All are suffering. If the ultimate act of **Ramadan** is to give of oneself completely to alleviate suffering, in obedience to God’s will… then perhaps this is my test. A final, terrible *sadaqah*.

He speaks with passion, but his hands tremble.

**YUKI**
That is a noble impulse, Kanji. But is it wisdom? Or is it fear speaking, dressed as piety? You tremble.

**KANJI**
Of course I tremble! Who wouldn’t?

**YUKI**
Exactly. Your offer comes from a swirling place of fear, duty, and religious fervor. Let us think, not just feel. In my tradition—the Daoist part of me—we speak of **Chengfu**.

Momoko leans forward, interested.

**MOMOKO**
“Returning to simplicity”? The state of an uncarved block?

**YUKI**
Yes. But more. It is the burden of one’s innate nature, the karma of your very being before you even act. The weight you are born to carry. My Buddhist side would call it *vāsanā*, the karmic imprints. We three were all born at the same, absurdly specific moment. 1:11 am, January 1st, 2001. Why? What is the **Chengfu** of that moment? What is the collective burden we share, simply by being here, born then?

**KANJI**
You think it’s fate? That one of us was *meant* for this?

**YUKI**
I think our coincidence is too great to be mere chance. The Dao flows, and we are in a violent whirlpool of its making. Our task is not to fight the current with blind sacrifice, but to understand our place within it. Perhaps the one whose nature is most aligned with this… ridiculous, tragic sacrifice… is the one who should go. Not the one who is most afraid of hell or most eager for heaven.

**MOMOKO**
You speak of understanding the current. But my faith speaks of a God who is the source of the river itself. And this… this horror of the bears, the slaughter, the collapse… it forces the oldest question to the surface. The one we call the problem of evil.

She stands, walking to the window. The bear is gone, leaving only ruins.

**MOMOKO (CONT'D)**
If God is all-good, He would want to stop this. If He is all-powerful, He could stop this. If He is all-knowing, He would have foreseen and prevented it. Yet the bears rule Japan. So, where is God? Is He not good? Not powerful? Or… is this part of some plan we cannot fathom?

**KANJI**
It is a test! Like the story of Ibrahim and Ismail. God tested their obedience. This is a test for Japan, for us!

**MOMOKO**
Is it? To allow children to be torn apart by bears as a *test*? That does not sound like love. It sounds like cruelty. And yet… my faith insists: **God is love**. Not just loving, but Love itself. The very essence.

She turns to face them, her eyes intense.

**MOMOKO (CONT'D)**
Love needs freedom to be real.
God gave us—and maybe even the bears—true freedom of choice. They chose to leave the forest. They chose violence.
If God stepped in to force a different choice, we’d just be puppets. You can’t force love on a puppet. That freedom is worth the terrible price of their choice.

**YUKI**
So God values the principle of freedom more than the immediate prevention of suffering?

**MOMOKO**
You're right, it's not indifference. Love doesn't watch from a distance—it enters the suffering, like Christ on the cross.
So if I go, it won't be to fulfill a myth or please a god. It will be an act of love. A choice to enter a broken world and share its pain, to save others from it. Not because I have to, but because true love, when faced with evil, chooses sacrifice.

**KANJI**
That… is beautiful, Momoko. But it is also very Christian. It turns the Doraemon costume into a cross.

**MOMOKO**
Perhaps. Or perhaps it’s just what love looks like when the world is overrun by bears.

A faint, grim smile touches her lips.

**YUKI**
Your explanation about evil makes sense from a distance. It's about the stage, but not the actors.
My view focuses on karma—the action itself. It's about cause and effect. Every action plant  a seed.
The bears' violence is the fruit of many causes: our invasion of their home, the changing world. Us being here is also a result of past causes. The choice we make now will plant a new seed with huge consequences for the future.

She pours water from a pitcher into three cups, a deliberate, calming motion.

**YUKI (CONT'D)**
The reason why we go matters as much as going itself.
If Kanji goes out of fear, that action is rooted in fear. If Momoko goes in loving sacrifice, it may carry a hidden pride. If I go, I must ask: am I trying to truly end the cycle of suffering, or just running from my own?
Karma is precise. The intention plants the seed.

**KANJI**
So we must not only decide *who*, but *with what mind*? That’s impossible to purify!

**YUKI**
It is the work of a lifetime. We have two hours. The point is, we must be ruthlessly honest. This is not about earning a reward. In Buddhism, sacrifice for reward is still a transaction, binding you to the cycle. The ultimate goal is to act with such selfless compassion that you break the cycle. For the sake of all beings. Including the bears.

Momoko and Kanji stare at her.

**MOMOKO**
Compassion… for the bears?

**YUKI**
They are suffering too. They are driven by a hunger they do not understand, a search for a mythical ruler. They are trapped in aggression and fear. They are part of the sentient world suffering from ignorance. A Bodhisattva would have compassion for them as well. So the act of going… if done with that ultimate, impartial compassion… could generate immense, liberating merit. Not for me, but for the situation itself.

She sips her water.

**YUKI (CONT'D)**
But I am not a Bodhisattva. I am Yuki, who is afraid. My **Chengfu** is mixed. I have Daoist detachment and Buddhist aspiration, but also a human will to live. So I must weigh this.

**KANJI**
This is too philosophical! We are talking about being torn apart! My faith gives a clearer path: submission to God’s will. If it is God’s will that I go, I go. Ramadan taught me submission. But how do we *know* God’s will? The Prime Minister is not a prophet. The Shinto master is not my imam.

He puts his head in his hands.

**KANJI (CONT'D)**
I offered to go. But now… your words confuse me. Is my offer true submission, or just a desperate attempt to make sense of the chaos? To force God’s hand?

**MOMOKO**
That is a brave introspection, Kanji.

**YUKI**
It is. And it touches on **Chengfu** again. Your innate nature, Kanji, is passionate and devout. That is your burden and your gift. To act against it would be a violence to yourself. To act solely from its fever pitch might be unwise. You must find its still center.

**NARRATOR**
An alarm clock on the wall ticks loudly. An hour has passed.

**MOMOKO**
We’re going in circles. We’ve applied our concepts: **Chengfu**, **God is love**, **Ramadan**, **Karma**, the **explanation of evil**. They illuminate, but they don’t decide.

She walks back to the table, standing between them.

**MOMOKO (CONT'D)**
Perhaps we are asking the wrong question. We’re asking “Who should die?” as if it’s a philosophical contest. Maybe the question is “Who can do this thing, and what will it *mean*?”

**YUKI**
Meaning is bestowed by the mind behind the act.

**MOMOKO**
Exactly. Kanji, if you go, your act becomes one of *Islamic* submission to the Divine Decree, a final, profound Ramadan sacrifice. It will be remembered, if anyone remains to remember, as a Muslim act. It will link your faith to the salvation of Japan.

**KANJI**
(Whispering)
That is… a heavy responsibility. To represent all of us…

**MOMOKO**
Yuki, if you go, your act becomes one of *Buddhist-Daoist* compassion and karmic resolution. A release from cycles. An alignment with the Dao’s flow, even into the jaws of bears. It becomes a meditation made flesh.

**YUKI**
And if I fail in my mindfulness at the final moment? If I scream in terror? The karma is then stained.

**MOMOKO**
And if I go… it becomes a *Christian* act of sacrificial love. A participation in the divine response to evil. A statement that love enters the darkest place.

She looks at them both.

**MOMOKO (CONT'D)**
So it’s not just who dies. It’s which story dies with them. Which face of the divine is presented to the Bear King. The Shinto master said the bears obey Doraemon. But *we* will fill that empty symbol with meaning. We will clothe a cartoon in theology.

**NARRATOR**
A profound silence settles. The concept changes the room.

**KANJI**
Then… it is not about our worthiness to die. It is about the message that is needed.

**YUKI**
What does Japan need to see in its sacrifice? What lesson for the survivors?

**MOMOKO**
A lesson of love? Of submission? Of compassionate release?

**YUKI**
Japan is a suffering, fragmented place. Shinto itself is animist, seeing spirit in all things, even bears. Perhaps what is needed is not a message from one pure tradition, but a synthesis. A gesture that acknowledges the interconnected suffering of all beings—human and bear—and seeks to end it without hatred.

**KANJI**
That sounds more like your path, Yuki.

**YUKI**
It does. But I am not pure. My synthesis is intellectual. My fear is visceral. My **Chengfu** may be to understand, not to do.

**NARRATOR**
Another silence. The second hour begins to wane.

**KANJI**
I have been thinking. About your **God is love**, Momoko. And about submission. In Islam, God is Al-Wadud, the Loving. His will is an expression of that love, even when we cannot see it. To submit to that will is to trust in that love. My offer… it was not trust. It was a frantic bargain. “Take me so this ends.” That is not loving submission. That is terror. I must… I must withdraw my offer. For now. I need to find the calmness (*sakinah*) to see rightly.

He looks devastated but clearer.

**MOMOKO**
Thank you for your honesty, Kanji. It is a brave step.

**YUKI**
And I have been thinking of **Karma**. If I go seeking to be a Bodhisattva, the very seeking plants the seed of ego. The ‘I’ who will be a hero. The ‘I’ who will generate merit. It is a trap. True compassion is without a self who is compassionate. I… I do not know if I am capable of that. My action, however well-intentioned, might be karmically muddy. It might not bring the pure resolution this catastrophe needs.

She looks at Momoko, a new respect in her eyes.

**YUKI (CONT'D)**
You, Momoko. You spoke of love not as a feeling, but as the nature of God. As a *person*. An act. You did not speak of imitating Christ as a transaction for salvation, but as entering into suffering because it is there, and love goes there. That… feels less karmically sticky. It is about the nature of the act itself, not its future fruit for the actor.

Momoko is taken aback. She sinks into her chair.

**MOMOKO**
You’re pointing at me.

**YUKI**
I am observing you. Your **Chengfu**… you were calm from the start. You did not offer impulsively or retreat into complex philosophy. You stated the problem of evil squarely and offered the theological answer not as a defense of God, but as a description of the battlefield. Your nature seems to be one of… grounded faith. Not blind, but seeing the horror and still speaking of love.

**KANJI**
It’s true. When you spoke of God suffering with us… it did not feel like a theory. It felt like a truth you lived.

**MOMOKO**
(Tears welling)
I am afraid. I do not want to die. The thought of those bears… it is a primal horror.

**YUKI**
Of course. But your fear does not negate your nature. It contextualizes it. A sacrifice without fear is no sacrifice. It is just a transaction.

**MOMOKO**
So you think… my going would be the right meaning? The needed story?

**YUKI**
Of the three paths, yours is the one this moment needs. Islam seeks submission, and Buddhism seeks release from the cycle. But the Christian path—of love walking willingly into the heart of evil—is about confrontation.
It engages. It takes this absurd costume and fills it with meaning. For a broken nation, the story it needs to see is one of pure, willing sacrifice. That is the seed we must plant.

**KANJI**
(Softly)
“For God so loved the world…” It is a powerful story. Perhaps it is the one that can reach even a Bear King’s heart. Or at least, the hearts of the people who will hear of it.

**NARRATOR**
Momoko looks out the window again. The sun is lower, casting long shadows through the broken city.

**MOMOKO**
If I do this… it is not because I believe the Shinto master’s myth. It is because I believe in the God who is love. And if Love has a place in this bear-ridden hell, it is beside the victim, becoming the victim, to stop the victimizing. Not by power, but by solidarity. Even if it looks like a fool in a Doraemon costume.

She turns back. Her face is streaked with tears, but serene.

**MOMOKO (CONT'D)**
I will go.

**NARRATOR**
The words hang in the air. Final.

A buzzer sounds. The two hours are up.

The door opens. The Prime Minister and officials stand there, holding a large box. Inside, we glimpse blue fur, a red plastic tail.

**PRIME MINISTER**
Have you decided?

Momoko steps forward. She does not look at the box. She looks at the Prime Minister, her voice steady.

**MOMOKO**
I have. I will be Doraemon.

The officials look relieved, then somber. One approaches with the box.

**MOMOKO (CONT'D)**
(To Yuki and Kanji)
Go home. Tell them… tell them love went to the bears. And that love is never wasted.

Yuki and Kanji are escorted out, looking back with a mixture of grief, awe, and guilt. The door closes, leaving Momoko alone with the government officials.

**EXT. TOKYO STREET - LATER**

**NARRATOR**
Momoko, wearing the full, slightly ridiculous Doraemon costume, is led towards the bear-occupied zone.

Momoko, wearing the full, slightly ridiculous Doraemon costume, head and all, is led by a military escort towards the edge of the occupied zone. Bears watch from the ruins. They do not attack. They seem… curious.

**INT. GOVERNMENT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS**

Yuki and Kanji watch from a monitor, holding each other’s hands for support.

**EXT. BEAR KING'S LAIR - A PLAZA**

A massive brown bear, scarred and majestic, sits on a makeshift throne of wrecked cars. Momoko is brought before it. She is trembling, the plastic head shaking.

She kneels. Then, with a deep breath, she removes the Doraemon head. Her human face is pale, tear-stained, but calm. She looks the Bear King in the eyes.

**MOMOKO**
(In a clear, carrying voice)
The search is over. I am here. Now… let your people go. Go back to the forests. Leave the cities. The killing ends now.

**NARRATOR**
The Bear King stares at her. At the human face inside the myth. It sniffs the air. A long, tense moment.

Then, it rears up on its hind legs and lets out a roar that shakes the rubble. But it is not a roar of attack. It sounds like a command.

All around, bears begin to disengage. They turn, and in a slow, solemn procession, they begin to move, heading north, towards the mountains.

Momoko watches them go. A single soldier remains, far behind her. She puts the Doraemon head back on. She does not follow the bears immediately. She stands, a small, blue figure in the vast, ruined plaza, watching the exodus of her tormentors.

On her face, through the plastic mouth of the costume, we see a glimpse of her human mouth. It is not smiling. But it is at peace.

**YUKI**
(V.O., whispering)
**Chengfu** fulfilled.

**KANJI**
(V.O., through tears)
God is love.

**MOMOKO**
(V.O., a gentle whisper)
And love has driven out the fear.

**NARRATOR**
The Bear King looks back at her one last time, then turns and lumbers away, leading his kind home. Momoko takes a deep breath, and begins to walk, following the bears into the gathering dusk.

**[SCENE END]**

**FINAL WORD COUNT: 3,347**
