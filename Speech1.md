**[SCENE START]**

**INT. BARE, SECURE GOVERNMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - 2026**

The room is stark, gray, and soundproofed. A single table with three chairs. One wall is a reinforced window looking out onto a silent, overgrown Tokyo street. A brown bear lumbers past in the distance.

Three people sit around the table: MOMOKO (25, thoughtful, calm), YUKI (25, sharp-eyed, contemplative), and KANJI (25, anxious, devout).

A heavy door clicks shut behind the retreating figure of a government official. The silence is oppressive.

**KANJI**
(Exhaling shakily)
So. This is it. We have two hours to decide which one of us… goes to the bears.

**MOMOKO**
(Quietly)
To die.

**YUKI**
Nods slowly, her eyes fixed on the bear outside.
The Prime Minister made that quite clear. One Doraemon. One sacrifice. The Bear King accepts nothing less. The Shinto master was… specific.

A pause. The weight of the absurdity and the horror sits with them.

**KANJI**
It’s madness. Cosplay as a blue cartoon cat to appease a bear king? It sounds like a child’s nightmare.

**MOMOKO**
But the bears are real. And 70% of our country… gone. The world is upside down. In such times, we grasp at stories. Even old children’s stories. The master said the bears believe it. That is the reality we must navigate.

**YUKI**
The reality is, one of us must wear the costume and die. The question is *who*. And *why*. We are not just three names. We are… what we believe. They told us that. It’s why they mentioned our faiths. They expect our beliefs to guide us. Or to conflict.

Another long silence. Kanji fidgets, his lips moving in silent prayer.

**KANJI**
I… I should go.

Momoko and Yuki look at him, surprised.

**MOMOKO**
Why, Kanji?

**KANJI**
Because it is Ramadan. Well, it was. It ended last week. But… the spirit remains. Fasting, yes, but more than that. It is about self-discipline, sacrifice, and empathy for those who suffer. For thirty days, we abstain to draw closer to God, to purify ourselves, to remember the needy. Now… look outside. All of Japan is needy. All are suffering. If the ultimate act of **Ramadan** is to give of oneself completely to alleviate suffering, in obedience to God’s will… then perhaps this is my test. A final, terrible *sadaqah*.

He speaks with passion, but his hands tremble.

**YUKI**
That is a noble impulse, Kanji. But is it wisdom? Or is it fear speaking, dressed as piety? You tremble.

**KANJI**
Of course I tremble! Who wouldn’t?

**YUKI**
Exactly. Your offer comes from a swirling place of fear, duty, and religious fervor. Let us think, not just feel. In my tradition—the Daoist part of me—we speak of **Chengfu**.

Momoko leans forward, interested.

**MOMOKO**
“Returning to simplicity”? The state of an uncarved block?

**YUKI**
Yes. But more. It is the burden of one’s innate nature, the karma of your very being before you even act. The weight you are born to carry. My Buddhist side would call it *vāsanā*, the karmic imprints. We three were all born at the same, absurdly specific moment. 1:11 am, January 1st, 2001. Why? What is the **Chengfu** of that moment? What is the collective burden we share, simply by being here, born then?

**KANJI**
You think it’s fate? That one of us was *meant* for this?

**YUKI**
I think our coincidence is too great to be mere chance. The Dao flows, and we are in a violent whirlpool of its making. Our task is not to fight the current with blind sacrifice, but to understand our place within it. Perhaps the one whose nature is most aligned with this… ridiculous, tragic sacrifice… is the one who should go. Not the one who is most afraid of hell or most eager for heaven.

**MOMOKO**
You speak of understanding the current. But my faith speaks of a God who is the source of the river itself. And this… this horror of the bears, the slaughter, the collapse… it forces the oldest question to the surface. The one we call the problem of evil.

She stands, walking to the window. The bear is gone, leaving only ruins.

**MOMOKO (CONT'D)**
If God is all-good, He would want to stop this. If He is all-powerful, He could stop this. If He is all-knowing, He would have foreseen and prevented it. Yet the bears rule Japan. So, where is God? Is He not good? Not powerful? Or… is this part of some plan we cannot fathom?

**KANJI**
It is a test! Like the story of Ibrahim and Ismail. God tested their obedience. This is a test for Japan, for us!

**MOMOKO**
Is it? To allow children to be torn apart by bears as a *test*? That does not sound like love. It sounds like cruelty. And yet… my faith insists: **God is love**. Not just loving, but Love itself. The very essence.

She turns to face them, her eyes intense.

**MOMOKO (CONT'D)**
So how do I reconcile Love itself with this? One explanation is free will. God gave us, and perhaps all creation, genuine freedom. The bears, in their animal consciousness, have a form of it. They chose to leave the forest. They choose violence. God does not stop them because to do so would make us puppets, and love cannot be forced upon puppets. Love requires freedom, even at the terrible cost of misused freedom.

**YUKI**
So God values the principle of freedom more than the immediate prevention of suffering?

**MOMOKO**
It seems so. But it’s not indifference. Love enters into the suffering. Christ on the cross is the symbol of that—God *with us* in the worst of it. Not a remote observer, but a fellow sufferer. So my choice, if I were to go… it would not be to appease a bear king for a Shinto god. It would be an act of entering into the brokenness, an imitation of that divine love. A willing descent into the consequence of a broken world, to save others from it. Not because I am forced, but because love, in the face of evil, chooses to sacrifice.

**KANJI**
That… is beautiful, Momoko. But it is also very Christian. It turns the Doraemon costume into a cross.

**MOMOKO**
Perhaps. Or perhaps it’s just what love looks like when the world is overrun by bears.

A faint, grim smile touches her lips.

**YUKI**
Your explanation of evil is logical, Momoko. But it is a spectator’s explanation. It explains the *why* of the stage, but not the *action* of the players. My Buddhist focus is on the action itself—**Karma**. Not fate, not punishment, but cause and effect. Volitional action creates seeds. These seeds bear fruit. The bears’ violence is the fruit of countless causes—human encroachment, climate change, ecological imbalance. Our presence here is the fruit of being born at that specific time. And our decision today will plant a new seed with immense consequences.

She pours water from a pitcher into three cups, a deliberate, calming motion.

**YUKI (CONT'D)**
If Kanji goes out of fearful obligation, the seed is tainted by fear. If Momoko goes as an imitation of Christ, the seed is watered with love but may carry a subtle pride of martyrdom. If I go… I must examine my own motives. Do I seek to end the cycle of suffering, or to escape my own? Karma is meticulous. The intention behind the sacrifice is as important as the act.

**KANJI**
So we must not only decide *who*, but *with what mind*? That’s impossible to purify!

**YUKI**
It is the work of a lifetime. We have two hours. The point is, we must be ruthlessly honest. This is not about earning a reward. In Buddhism, sacrifice for reward is still a transaction, binding you to the cycle. The ultimate goal is to act with such selfless compassion that you break the cycle. For the sake of all beings. Including the bears.

Momoko and Kanji stare at her.

**MOMOKO**
Compassion… for the bears?

**YUKI**
They are suffering too. They are driven by a hunger they do not understand, a search for a mythical ruler. They are trapped in aggression and fear. They are part of the sentient world suffering from ignorance. A Bodhisattva would have compassion for them as well. So the act of going… if done with that ultimate, impartial compassion… could generate immense, liberating merit. Not for me, but for the situation itself.

She sips her water.

**YUKI (CONT'D)**
But I am not a Bodhisattva. I am Yuki, who is afraid. My **Chengfu** is mixed. I have Daoist detachment and Buddhist aspiration, but also a human will to live. So I must weigh this.

**KANJI**
This is too philosophical! We are talking about being torn apart! My faith gives a clearer path: submission to God’s will. If it is God’s will that I go, I go. Ramadan taught me submission. But how do we *know* God’s will? The Prime Minister is not a prophet. The Shinto master is not my imam.

He puts his head in his hands.

**KANJI (CONT'D)**
I offered to go. But now… your words confuse me. Is my offer true submission, or just a desperate attempt to make sense of the chaos? To force God’s hand?

**MOMOKO**
That is a brave introspection, Kanji.

**YUKI**
It is. And it touches on **Chengfu** again. Your innate nature, Kanji, is passionate and devout. That is your burden and your gift. To act against it would be a violence to yourself. To act solely from its fever pitch might be unwise. You must find its still center.

An alarm clock on the wall ticks loudly. An hour has passed.

**MOMOKO**
We’re going in circles. We’ve applied our concepts: **Chengfu**, **God is love**, **Ramadan**, **Karma**, the **explanation of evil**. They illuminate, but they don’t decide.

She walks back to the table, standing between them.

**MOMOKO (CONT'D)**
Perhaps we are asking the wrong question. We’re asking “Who should die?” as if it’s a philosophical contest. Maybe the question is “Who can do this thing, and what will it *mean*?”

**YUKI**
Meaning is bestowed by the mind behind the act.

**MOMOKO**
Exactly. Kanji, if you go, your act becomes one of *Islam* submission to the Divine Decree, a final, profound Ramadan sacrifice. It will be remembered, if anyone remains to remember, as a Muslim act. It will link your faith to the salvation of Japan.

**KANJI**
(Whispering)
That is… a heavy responsibility. To represent all of us…

**MOMOKO**
Yuki, if you go, your act becomes one of *Buddhist-Daoist* compassion and karmic resolution. A release from cycles. A alignment with the Dao’s flow, even into the jaws of bears. It becomes a meditation made flesh.

**YUKI**
And if I fail in my mindfulness at the final moment? If I scream in terror? The karma is then stained.

**MOMOKO**
And if I go… it becomes a *Christian* act of sacrificial love. A participation in the divine response to evil. A statement that love enters the darkest place.

She looks at them both.

**MOMOKO (CONT'D)**
So it’s not just who dies. It’s which story dies with them. Which face of the divine is presented to the Bear King. The Shinto master said the bears obey Doraemon. But *we* will fill that empty symbol with meaning. We will clothe a cartoon in theology.

A profound silence settles. The concept changes the room.

**KANJI**
Then… it is not about our worthiness to die. It is about the message that is needed.

**YUKI**
What does Japan need to see in its sacrifice? What lesson for the survivors?

**MOMOKO**
A lesson of love? Of submission? Of compassionate release?

**YUKI**
Japan is a suffering, fragmented place. Shinto itself is animist, seeing spirit in all things, even bears. Perhaps what is needed is not a message from one pure tradition, but a synthesis. A gesture that acknowledges the interconnected suffering of all beings—human and bear—and seeks to end it without hatred.

**KANJI**
That sounds more like your path, Yuki.

**YUKI**
It does. But I am not pure. My synthesis is intellectual. My fear is visceral. My **Chengfu** may be to understand, not to do.

Another silence. The second hour begins to wane.

**KANJI**
I have been thinking. About your **God is love**, Momoko. And about submission. In Islam, God is Al-Wadud, the Loving. His will is an expression of that love, even when we cannot see it. To submit to that will is to trust in that love. My offer… it was not trust. It was a frantic bargain. “Take me so this ends.” That is not loving submission. That is terror. I must… I must withdraw my offer. For now. I need to find the calmness (*sakinah*) to see rightly.

He looks devastated but clearer.

**MOMOKO**
Thank you for your honesty, Kanji. It is a brave step.

**YUKI**
And I have been thinking of **Karma**. If I go seeking to be a Bodhisattva, the very seeking plants the seed of ego. The ‘I’ who will be a hero. The ‘I’ who will generate merit. It is a trap. True compassion is without a self who is compassionate. I… I do not know if I am capable of that. My action, however well-intentioned, might be karmically muddy. It might not bring the pure resolution this catastrophe needs.

She looks at Momoko, a new respect in her eyes.

**YUKI (CONT'D)**
You, Momoko. You spoke of love not as a feeling, but as the nature of God. As a *person*. An act. You did not speak of imitating Christ as a transaction for salvation, but as entering into suffering because it is there, and love goes there. That… feels less karmically sticky. It is about the nature of the act itself, not its future fruit for the actor.

Momoko is taken aback. She sinks into her chair.

**MOMOKO**
You’re pointing at me.

**YUKI**
I am observing you. Your **Chengfu**… you were calm from the start. You did not offer impulsively or retreat into complex philosophy. You stated the problem of evil squarely and offered the theological answer not as a defense of God, but as a description of the battlefield. Your nature seems to be one of… grounded faith. Not blind, but seeing the horror and still speaking of love.

**KANJI**
It’s true. When you spoke of God suffering with us… it did not feel like a theory. It felt like a truth you lived.

**MOMOKO**
(Tears welling)
I am afraid. I do not want to die. The thought of those bears… it is a primal horror.

**YUKI**
Of course. But your fear does not negate your nature. It contextualizes it. A sacrifice without fear is no sacrifice. It is just a transaction.

**MOMOKO**
So you think… my going would be the right meaning? The needed story?

**YUKI**
I think of the three paths, the Christian one—of love entering freely into the heart of evil to break its power—is the one that most directly addresses the moment. It does not seek to escape the cycle like Buddhism, or submit to an inscrutable will like Islam, though it has echoes of both. It confronts. It engages. It takes the absurd costume and makes it a vessel for the deepest truth of your tradition. For a nation in despair, the story of a willing, loving sacrifice may be the seed that needs planting.

**KANJI**
(Softly)
“For God so loved the world…” It is a powerful story. Perhaps it is the one that can reach even a Bear King’s heart. Or at least, the hearts of the people who will hear of it.

Momoko looks out the window again. The sun is lower, casting long shadows through the broken city.

**MOMOKO**
If I do this… it is not because I believe the Shinto master’s myth. It is because I believe in the God who is love. And if Love has a place in this bear-ridden hell, it is beside the victim, becoming the victim, to stop the victimizing. Not by power, but by solidarity. Even if it looks like a fool in a Doraemon costume.

She turns back. Her face is streaked with tears, but serene.

**MOMOKO (CONT'D)**
I will go.

The words hang in the air. Final.

**YUKI**
(Nods, a deep bow of respect)
Your **Karma** is clear. Your intention is for love, not for self. May it bring an end to this suffering.

**KANJI**
(His voice choked)
I will pray for you, Momoko. I will remember this as the true meaning of sacrifice. You have… you have helped me understand submission better. It is not blind. It is trusting in Love.

**MOMOKO**
Thank you, both of you. You have helped me see my own faith more clearly. The problem of evil… it is not solved in a textbook. It is answered on the ground. In acts. However small. However strange.

A buzzer sounds. The two hours are up.

The door opens. The Prime Minister and officials stand there, holding a large box. Inside, we glimpse blue fur, a red plastic tail.

**PRIME MINISTER**
Have you decided?

Momoko steps forward. She does not look at the box. She looks at the Prime Minister, her voice steady.

**MOMOKO**
I have. I will be Doraemon.

The officials look relieved, then somber. One approaches with the box.

**MOMOKO (CONT'D)**
(To Yuki and Kanji)
Go home. Tell them… tell them love went to the bears. And that love is never wasted.

Yuki and Kanji are escorted out, looking back with a mixture of grief, awe, and guilt. The door closes, leaving Momoko alone with the government officials.

**EXT. TOKYO STREET - LATER**

Momoko, wearing the full, slightly ridiculous Doraemon costume, head and all, is led by a military escort towards the edge of the occupied zone. Bears watch from the ruins. They do not attack. They seem… curious.

**INT. GOVERNMENT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS**

Yuki and Kanji watch from a monitor, holding each other’s hands for support.

**EXT. BEAR KING'S LAIR - A PLAZA**

A massive brown bear, scarred and majestic, sits on a makeshift throne of wrecked cars. Momoko is brought before it. She is trembling, the plastic head shaking.

She kneels. Then, with a deep breath, she removes the Doraemon head. Her human face is pale, tear-stained, but calm. She looks the Bear King in the eyes.

**MOMOKO**
(In a clear, carrying voice)
The search is over. I am here. Now… let your people go. Go back to the forests. Leave the cities. The killing ends now.

The Bear King stares at her. At the human face inside the myth. It sniffs the air. A long, tense moment.

Then, it rears up on its hind legs and lets out a roar that shakes the rubble. But it is not a roar of attack. It sounds like a command.

All around, bears begin to disengage. They turn, and in a slow, solemn procession, they begin to move, heading north, towards the mountains.

Momoko watches them go. A single soldier remains, far behind her. She puts the Doraemon head back on. She does not follow the bears immediately. She stands, a small, blue figure in the vast, ruined plaza, watching the exodus of her tormentors.

On her face, through the plastic mouth of the costume, we see a glimpse of her human mouth. It is not smiling. But it is at peace.

**YUKI**
(V.O., whispering)
**Chengfu** fulfilled.

**KANJI**
(V.O., through tears)
God is love.

**MOMOKO**
(V.O., a gentle whisper)
And love has driven out the fear.

The Bear King looks back at her one last time, then turns and lumbers away, leading his kind home. Momoko takes a deep breath, and begins to walk, following the bears into the gathering dusk.

**[SCENE END]**

**FINAL WORD COUNT: 3, 248**
