It is about self-discipline, sacrifice, and empathy for those who suffer. For thirty days, we abstain to draw closer to God, to purify ourselves, to remember the needy. Now… look outside. All of Japan is needy. All are suffering. If the ultimate act of Ramadan is to give of oneself completely to alleviate suffering, in obedience to God's will… then perhaps this is my test.

It's about cause and effect. Every action plant a seed. The bears' violence is the fruit of many causes: our invasion of their home, the changing world. Us being here is also a result of past causes.

                <div class="dialogue">Of course. But your fear does not negate your nature. It contextualizes it. A sacrifice without fear is no sacrifice. It is just a transaction.</div>

                <div class="dialogue">Of the three paths, yours is the one this moment needs. Islam seeks submission, and Buddhism seeks release from the cycle. But the Christian path—of love walking willingly into the heart of evil—is about confrontation. It engages. It takes this absurd costume and fills it with meaning. For a broken nation, the story it needs to see is one of pure, willing sacrifice. That is the seed we must plant.</div>
                <div class="character kanji">KANJI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">(Softly) "For God so loved the world…" It is a powerful story. Perhaps it is the one that can reach even a Bear King's heart. Or at least, the hearts of the people who will hear of it.</div>
