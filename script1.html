                <p class="scene-heading">INT. BARE, SECURE GOVERNMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - 2026</p>
                
                <div class="narrator">
                    Tokyo, 2026. A city held by bears. In a secure room, three people—Momoko, Yuki, and Kanji—face an impossible choice. One must become Doraemon and die to save Japan. They have two hours to decide.
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Initial Dialogue -->
            <section>
                <div class="character">KANJI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">(Exhaling shakily) So. This is it. We have two hours to decide which one of us… goes to the bears.</div>

                <div class="character">MOMOKO</div>
                <div class="dialogue">(Quietly) To die.</div>

                <div class="character">YUKI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">Nods slowly, her eyes fixed on the bear outside. The Prime Minister made that quite clear. One Doraemon. One sacrifice. The Bear King accepts nothing less. The Shinto master was… specific.</div>

                <div class="narrator">A pause. The weight of the absurdity and the horror sits with them.</div>
            </section>

            <!-- The Discussion Begins -->
            <section>
                <div class="character">KANJI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">It’s madness. Cosplay as a blue cartoon cat to appease a bear king? It sounds like a child’s nightmare.</div>

                <div class="character">MOMOKO</div>
                <div class="dialogue">But the bears are real. And 70% of our country… gone. The world is upside down. In such times, we grasp at stories. Even old children’s stories. The master said the bears believe it. That is the reality we must navigate.</div>

                <div class="character">YUKI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">The reality is, one of us must wear the costume and die. The question is *who*. And *why*. We are not just three names. We are… what we believe. They told us that. It’s why they mentioned our faiths. They expect our beliefs to guide us. Or to conflict.</div>

                <div class="narrator">Another long silence. Kanji fidgets, his lips moving in silent prayer.</div>
            </section>

            <!-- Kanji's Offer -->
            <section>
                <div class="character">KANJI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">I… I should go.</div>

                <div class="narrator">Momoko and Yuki look at him, surprised.</div>

                <div class="character">MOMOKO</div>
                <div class="dialogue">Why, Kanji?</div>

                <div class="character">KANJI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">Because it is <span class="concept">Ramadan</span>. Well, it was. It ended last week. But… the spirit remains. Fasting, yes, but more than that. It is about self-discipline, sacrifice, and empathy for those who suffer. For thirty days, we abstain to draw closer to God, to purify ourselves, to remember the needy. Now… look outside. All of Japan is needy. All are suffering. If the ultimate act of <span class="concept">Ramadan</span> is to give of oneself completely to alleviate suffering, in obedience to God’s will… then perhaps this is my test. A final, terrible *sadaqah*.</div>

                <div class="narrator">He speaks with passion, but his hands tremble.</div>
            </section>

            <!-- Yuki Introduces Chengfu -->
            <section>
                <div class="character">YUKI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">That is a noble impulse, Kanji. But is it wisdom? Or is it fear speaking, dressed as piety? You tremble.</div>

                <div class="character">KANJI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">Of course I tremble! Who wouldn’t?</div>

                <div class="character">YUKI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">Exactly. Your offer comes from a swirling place of fear, duty, and religious fervor. Let us think, not just feel. In my tradition—the Daoist part of me—we speak of <span class="concept">Chengfu</span>.</div>

                <div class="narrator">Momoko leans forward, interested.</div>

                <div class="character">MOMOKO</div>
                <div class="dialogue">"Returning to simplicity"? The state of an uncarved block?</div>

                <div class="character">YUKI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">Yes. But more. It is the burden of one’s innate nature, the karma of your very being before you even act. The weight you are born to carry. My Buddhist side would call it *vāsanā*, the karmic imprints. We three were all born at the same, absurdly specific moment. 1:11 am, January 1st, 2001. Why? What is the <span class="concept">Chengfu</span> of that moment? What is the collective burden we share, simply by being here, born then?</div>
            </section>

            <!-- Momoko Introduces the Problem of Evil -->
            <section>
                <div class="character">MOMOKO</div>
                <div class="dialogue">You speak of understanding the current. But my faith speaks of a God who is the source of the river itself. And this… this horror of the bears, the slaughter, the collapse… it forces the oldest question to the surface. The one we call the problem of evil.</div>

                <div class="narrator">She stands, walking to the window. The bear is gone, leaving only ruins.</div>

                <div class="character">MOMOKO (CONT'D)</div>
                <div class="dialogue">If God is all-good, He would want to stop this. If He is all-powerful, He could stop this. If He is all-knowing, He would have foreseen and prevented it. Yet the bears rule Japan. So, where is God? Is He not good? Not powerful? Or… is this part of some plan we cannot fathom?</div>
            </section>

            <!-- God is Love -->
            <section>
                <div class="character">MOMOKO (CONT'D)</div>
                <div class="dialogue">And yet… my faith insists: <span class="concept">God is love</span>. Not just loving, but Love itself. The very essence.</div>

                <div class="narrator">She turns to face them, her eyes intense.</div>

                <div class="character">MOMOKO (CONT'D)</div>
                <div class="dialogue">So how do I reconcile Love itself with this? One explanation is free will. God gave us, and perhaps all creation, genuine freedom. The bears, in their animal consciousness, have a form of it. They chose to leave the forest. They choose violence. God does not stop them because to do so would make us puppets, and love cannot be forced upon puppets. Love requires freedom, even at the terrible cost of misused freedom.</div>
            </section>

            <!-- Yuki on Karma -->
            <section>
                <div class="character">YUKI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">Your explanation of evil is logical, Momoko. But it is a spectator’s explanation. It explains the *why* of the stage, but not the *action* of the players. My Buddhist focus is on the action itself—<span class="concept">Karma</span>. Not fate, not punishment, but cause and effect. Volitional action creates seeds. These seeds bear fruit.</div>

                <div class="character">YUKI (CONT'D)</div>
                <div class="dialogue">If Kanji goes out of fearful obligation, the seed is tainted by fear. If Momoko goes as an imitation of Christ, the seed is watered with love but may carry a subtle pride of martyrdom. If I go… I must examine my own motives. Do I seek to end the cycle of suffering, or to escape my own? <span class="concept">Karma</span> is meticulous. The intention behind the sacrifice is as important as the act.</div>
            </section>

            <!-- The Turning Point -->
            <section>
                <div class="narrator">An alarm clock on the wall ticks loudly. An hour has passed.</div>

                <div class="character">MOMOKO</div>
                <div class="dialogue">We’re going in circles. We’ve applied our concepts: <span class="concept">Chengfu</span>, <span class="concept">God is love</span>, <span class="concept">Ramadan</span>, <span class="concept">Karma</span>, the <span class="concept">explanation of evil</span>. They illuminate, but they don’t decide.</div>

                <div class="character">MOMOKO (CONT'D)</div>
                <div class="dialogue">Perhaps we are asking the wrong question. We’re asking "Who should die?" as if it’s a philosophical contest. Maybe the question is "Who can do this thing, and what will it *mean*?"</div>
            </section>

            <!-- What Meaning Will It Have? -->
            <section>
                <div class="character">MOMOKO (CONT'D)</div>
                <div class="dialogue">Exactly. Kanji, if you go, your act becomes one of *Islamic* submission to the Divine Decree, a final, profound Ramadan sacrifice. It will be remembered, if anyone remains to remember, as a Muslim act.</div>

                <div class="character">MOMOKO (CONT'D)</div>
                <div class="dialogue">Yuki, if you go, your act becomes one of *Buddhist-Daoist* compassion and karmic resolution. A release from cycles. An alignment with the Dao’s flow, even into the jaws of bears.</div>

                <div class="character">MOMOKO (CONT'D)</div>
                <div class="dialogue">And if I go… it becomes a *Christian* act of sacrificial love. A participation in the divine response to evil. A statement that love enters the darkest place.</div>
            </section>

            <!-- The Decision Forms -->
            <section>
                <div class="character">MOMOKO (CONT'D)</div>
                <div class="dialogue">So it’s not just who dies. It’s which story dies with them. Which face of the divine is presented to the Bear King. The Shinto master said the bears obey Doraemon. But *we* will fill that empty symbol with meaning. We will clothe a cartoon in theology.</div>

                <div class="narrator">A profound silence settles. The concept changes the room.</div>
            </section>

            <!-- Final Realizations -->
            <section>
                <div class="character">YUKI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">You, Momoko. You spoke of love not as a feeling, but as the nature of God. As a *person*. An act. You did not speak of imitating Christ as a transaction for salvation, but as entering into suffering because it is there, and love goes there. That… feels less karmically sticky.</div>

                <div class="character">MOMOKO</div>
                <div class="dialogue">(Tears welling) I am afraid. I do not want to die. The thought of those bears… it is a primal horror.</div>

                <div class="character">YUKI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">Of course. But your fear does not negate your nature. It contextualizes it. A sacrifice without fear is no sacrifice. It is just a transaction.</div>
            </section>

            <!-- Momoko's Decision -->
            <section>
                <div class="narrator">Momoko looks out the window again. The sun is lower, casting long shadows through the broken city.</div>

                <div class="character">MOMOKO</div>
                <div class="dialogue">If I do this… it is not because I believe the Shinto master’s myth. It is because I believe in the God who is love. And if Love has a place in this bear-ridden hell, it is beside the victim, becoming the victim, to stop the victimizing. Not by power, but by solidarity. Even if it looks like a fool in a Doraemon costume.</div>

                <div class="narrator">She turns back. Her face is streaked with tears, but serene.</div>

                <div class="character">MOMOKO (CONT'D)</div>
                <div class="dialogue" style="color: #81C784; font-size: 1.3em;">I will go.</div>

                <div class="narrator">A massive brown bear, scarred and majestic, sits on a makeshift throne of wrecked cars. Momoko is brought before it. She is trembling, the plastic head shaking.</div>

                <div class="narrator">She kneels. Then, with a deep breath, she removes the Doraemon head. Her human face is pale, tear-stained, but calm. She looks the Bear King in the eyes.</div>

                <div class="character">MOMOKO</div>
                <div class="dialogue">(In a clear, carrying voice) The search is over. I am here. Now… let your people go. Go back to the forests. Leave the cities. The killing ends now.</div>

            <section>
                <div class="narrator">The Bear King stares at her. At the human face inside the myth. It sniffs the air. A long, tense moment.</div>

                <div class="narrator">Then, it rears up on its hind legs and lets out a roar that shakes the rubble. But it is not a roar of attack. It sounds like a command.</div>

                <div class="narrator">All around, bears begin to disengage. They turn, and in a slow, solemn procession, they begin to move, heading north, towards the mountains.</div>

                <div class="narrator">Momoko watches them go. She puts the Doraemon head back on. She does not follow the bears immediately. She stands, a small, blue figure in the vast, ruined plaza, watching the exodus of her tormentors.</div>
