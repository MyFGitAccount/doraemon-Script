It is about self-discipline, sacrifice, and empathy for those who suffer. For thirty days, we abstain to draw closer to God, to purify ourselves, to remember the needy. Now… look outside. All of Japan is needy. All are suffering. If the ultimate act of <span class="concept">Ramadan</span> is to give of oneself completely to alleviate suffering, in obedience to God's will… then perhaps this is my test. A final, terrible *sadaqah*.

                        So how do I reconcile Love itself with this? One explanation is free will. God gave us, and perhaps all creation, genuine freedom. The bears, in their animal consciousness, have a form of it. They chose to leave the forest. They choose violence. God does not stop them because to do so would make us puppets, and love cannot be forced upon puppets. Love requires freedom, even at the terrible cost of misused freedom.

Not a remote observer, but a fellow sufferer. So my choice, if I were to go… it would not be to appease a bear king for a Shinto god. It would be an act of entering into the brokenness, an imitation of that divine love. A willing descent into the consequence of a broken world, to save others from it. Not because I am forced, but because love, in the face of evil, chooses to sacrifice.

                        Japan is a suffering, fragmented place. Shinto itself is animist, seeing spirit in all things, even bears. Perhaps what is needed is not a message from one pure tradition, but a synthesis. A gesture that acknowledges the interconnected suffering of all beings—human and bear—and seeks to end it without hatred.

That is not loving submission. That is terror. I must… I must withdraw my offer. For now. I need to find the calmness (*sakinah*) to see rightly.

                        I think of the three paths, the Christian one—of love entering freely into the heart of evil to break its power—is the one that most directly addresses the moment. It does not seek to escape the cycle like Buddhism, or submit to an inscrutable will like Islam, though it has echoes of both. It confronts. It engages. It takes the absurd costume and makes it a vessel for the deepest truth of your tradition. For a nation in despair, the story of a willing, loving sacrifice may be the seed that needs planting.
