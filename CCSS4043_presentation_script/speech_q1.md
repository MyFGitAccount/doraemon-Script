## Speech 1: Re-globalization's Causes

---

**[SLIDE: "Re-globalization's Causes" with China and US sections]**

Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today I'm going to address a critical question: **When did re-globalization actually begin?**

The statement we're evaluating claims this is a post-COVID phenomenon. But I'd argue the evidence suggests otherwise.

Let me take you back to **2015**. This is when we start seeing fundamental shifts in China's behavior on the global stage. China began positioning itself not just as a participant in the US-led global order, but as a **world rule shaper**. We saw this across four dimensions: diplomacy, economics, military, and ideology.

In the **South China Sea**, China asserted its claims through the infamous **eleven-dash line**—directly contravening the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This wasn't just about territory; it was about challenging the maritime rules established by the West.

On the diplomatic front, we witnessed the rise of what's been termed **"wolf warrior diplomacy"** —a more assertive, confrontational approach to foreign relations that signaled China was no longer willing to "hide its capabilities and bide its time."

But China wasn't acting in a vacuum. On the other side of the Pacific, the United States was undergoing its own transformation. The **"America First"** agenda emerged, driven by several motivations: first, bringing fiscal balance to the US government; second, strengthening America's industrial base; and third, maintaining its global stance against a rising challenger.

This marked a fundamental **reorientation in US policy**. No longer was China viewed as a potential ally or a country to be integrated into the liberal order through engagement. Instead, China was now seen as a **rival to be contained**—a stance that continued and even intensified under the Biden administration.

So what were the motivations driving this new phase?

For **China**: reducing dependence on the West became paramount. The **Dual Circulation** strategy—prioritizing domestic consumption while maintaining international engagement—was about building **long-term strategic autonomy**. And underlying it all was the goal of national **rejuvenation**—reclaiming China's perceived rightful place in the world.

For the **US**: containment became the watchword. We saw this in the **Huawei bans**, the **chip export controls**, and the **2018 tariffs** that kicked off an escalating trade war. The **MAGA** movement pushed for reshoring and job protection. And critically, US policy toward allies shifted from what John Ikenberry called "benevolent hegemony" to something more transactional—even predatory.

So what does all this tell us?

The shift we're witnessing is fundamentally a move **from cost-efficiency and liberalism toward security, resilience, and what economists call geoeconomic fragmentation**. Some have called this a new Cold War framework.

And here's my key point: **this trajectory was well underway before COVID-19**. The pandemic didn't create these dynamics—it accelerated them. The foundations were laid in 2015, the trade war began in 2018, and by the time COVID hit, the tectonic plates had already shifted.

This matters because if we misdiagnose the timing, we misunderstand the nature of the change we're experiencing. Re-globalization isn't a sudden pandemic-induced shock—it's the culmination of nearly a decade of structural transformation in international relations.

Thank you.

## Speech 2: How Re-globalization Affects Hong Kong

---

**[SLIDE: "Re-globalization - how it affect Hong Kong"]**

Good morning/afternoon. Building on our understanding of when re-globalization began, I want to explore **how this new phase has transformed Hong Kong**—and why this transformation isn't simply a post-COVID adjustment.

Hong Kong's role in the old globalization model was clear: it was the **neutral middleman**, the semi-automatic hub connecting East and West. It operated on principles of market efficiency, minimal government intervention, and what we might call **constructive ambiguity**—a grey area that allowed it to bridge two worlds.

But re-globalization has fundamentally altered this equation. And crucially, many of these changes **predate the pandemic**.

Let's look at the evidence.

First, the **shift in governing ideology**. The old model prioritized market liberalism—the famous "small government" approach. Today, **political stability and national security override everything else**. This isn't a post-COVID novelty. The **Hong Kong National Security Law** was enacted in **June 2020**—right at the pandemic's peak, yes, but it reflected a long-term strategic vision from Beijing to tighten control and reduce Western influence.

Then came the **2021 electoral reform**, which reduced directly elected seats to just **22.2%** of the legislature. This fundamentally restructured Hong Kong's political landscape, prioritizing "patriots administering Hong Kong" over representative democracy.

But the transformation goes beyond domestic governance. Hong Kong's role in foreign affairs has also changed dramatically.

Consider **Panama**. In 2025, when a Hong Kong-based company's management of Panama Canal ports came under scrutiny, Hong Kong officials didn't stay silent. They actively defended the investments and criticized what they saw as political interference. This represents a shift from neutral facilitator to **active participant in China's diplomatic posture**.

Look at **trade policy**. In August 2023, when Japan began releasing treated nuclear water from Fukushima, Hong Kong **immediately followed China's embargo policy**—restricting imports from Japanese prefectures on the very same day. Now, you might say this is just public health protection. But the speed and alignment with Beijing's position show how trade is now used as a **tool of geopolitical signaling**, not just commercial policy.

And we're seeing more frequent **official commentary on foreign affairs** from Hong Kong leaders—something that would have been unthinkable in the old model, where Hong Kong's strength was its studied neutrality.

So what's the cumulative effect of these changes?

**Hong Kong can no longer maintain its grey area status.** It can no longer function as the ambiguous middleman between West and East. Instead, it has become something else entirely: **the frontline of the China-US geopolitical battlefield**.

Every decision Hong Kong makes, every policy it implements, is now filtered through this lens. Is it aligned with national security? Does it protect against Western influence? Does it serve China's broader strategic interests?

This is the new reality of re-globalization for Hong Kong. And it didn't start with COVID—it started with the fundamental reorientation of China's global posture and the US response to it. The pandemic may have accelerated these trends, but the trajectory was set years earlier.

Thank you.

## Speech 3: China's Use of Hong Kong as a Pivot Against US Policy

---

**[SLIDE: "China use HK as pivot against US policy" with RMB Internationalization, Parallel Channels, Pre-Existing Trajectory]**

Good morning/afternoon. My focus today is on perhaps the most strategic dimension of Hong Kong's transformation: **how China is using Hong Kong as a pivot in its competition with the United States**.

If the old Hong Kong was a passive bridge connecting two systems, the new Hong Kong is an **active instrument** in China's strategy to build economic resilience and reduce dependence on Western-dominated institutions.

Let me walk you through three key dimensions of this pivot.

**First: RMB Internationalization.**

In his 2024 budget speech, Hong Kong's Financial Secretary announced a **100 billion RMB Trade Financing Liquidity Facility**. This might sound like technical financial jargon, but its implications are profound.

This facility provides yuan liquidity to Hong Kong and foreign companies conducting trade with mainland China. The message is clear: **conduct your trade in renminbi, not dollars**. Every transaction that shifts from USD to RMB reduces the reach of the US financial system and the effectiveness of potential sanctions.

Hong Kong is being positioned as the **global offshore RMB hub**—the primary venue where international actors can access, hold, and use China's currency. This isn't just about financial efficiency; it's about **strategic autonomy**.

**Second: Building Parallel Channels.**

Programs like **Bond Connect** and **Stock Connect** allow international investors to access China's financial markets through Hong Kong. On the surface, this looks like integration. But look deeper, and you see something else: these are **financing channels that operate outside the dollar-based system**.

When a foreign investor buys Chinese bonds through Bond Connect, they're participating in a market denominated in renminbi, settled through Chinese infrastructure, governed by Chinese rules. They're engaging with China on China's terms, not through Western intermediaries.

This is what scholars call **institutional parallelism**—building alternative institutions that can function if access to Western-dominated ones is restricted.

**Third—and this is crucial—this trajectory pre-exists the pandemic.**

These initiatives aren't emergency responses to COVID or ad hoc reactions to recent tensions. They're part of a **long-term strategic vision** that Beijing has pursued for years.

The groundwork for RMB internationalization was laid in the late 2000s. The first Connect programs launched in 2014. The **mBridge project**—developing a digital currency platform with Thailand, UAE, and other partners to bypass dollar-based systems—has been in development since before the pandemic.

What we're seeing now is the **deepening and acceleration** of this trajectory, not its creation.

So what does this mean for understanding re-globalization?

It means that Hong Kong's transformation isn't just about politics or governance—it's about **fundamentally restructuring the financial architecture of globalization**. China is using Hong Kong to build what we might call a **"West-optional" financial system**—one that can connect to the West when advantageous, but can function independently when necessary.

This is the new pattern of globalization: not seamless integration under Western rules, but the emergence of **parallel systems** with their own rules, their own currencies, and their own institutions.

And Hong Kong sits at the center of this transformation—not as a neutral middleman, but as the strategic pivot for China's challenge to US financial dominance.

Thank you.

## Speech 4: Conclusion and Critical Evaluation

---

**[SLIDE: "Conclusion" with Resilient Metrics, Deepening Integration, Acceleration not Creation]**

Good morning/afternoon. I've been tasked with bringing these threads together and offering a **critical evaluation** of the original statement—that we're experiencing a new phase of "re-globalization" since COVID-19, with patterns significantly different from the past.

Based on the evidence we've examined, I want to offer a **nuanced conclusion** that both confirms and qualifies this claim.

Let me start with what the evidence **supports**.

There's no question that globalization today operates under different rules than it did in the 1990s or 2000s. The old model—characterized by open flows of goods and capital, efficiency-driven supply chains, and US-led institutions—has given way to something new.

We see this in **geopolitical decoupling**: the US revoking Hong Kong's special trade status, treating it as just another Chinese city. We see it in **supply chain fragmentation**: Apple moving production to India and Vietnam, reducing Hong Kong's logistics role. We see it in **technology blockades**: advanced semiconductors no longer flowing freely, with Hong Kong treated as part of mainland China for export controls.

We see it in **institutional parallelism**: the International Organization for Mediation in Wan Chai, founded primarily by Belt and Road countries, creating alternative dispute resolution mechanisms outside Western-dominated courts. The mBridge project building digital currency systems that bypass SWIFT. Gold storage and Bitcoin ETFs as hedges against financial sanctions.

And we see it in **governance transformation**: Hong Kong shifting from market efficiency to security-first governance, from neutrality to alignment.

By these measures, yes—globalization has fundamentally changed.

**But**—and this is my critical qualification—**when did this change begin?**

This is where the statement's framing becomes problematic. By attributing this new phase to the post-COVID period, it risks misdiagnosing both the timing and the nature of the transformation.

Consider three pieces of evidence:

**First, resilient metrics.** Trade flows, foreign direct investment, and tourism all rebounded rapidly after COVID-19 restrictions lifted. This suggests the pandemic was, in many ways, a **temporary disruption** rather than a structural shift. The underlying connectivity of the global economy proved remarkably resilient.

**Second, deepening integration.** Even as geopolitical tensions mounted, Hong Kong's financial integration with the mainland intensified. RMB internationalization advanced. Connect schemes expanded. Hong Kong's **intermediary function**—connecting global capital to Chinese markets—didn't diminish; it evolved.

**Third and most importantly: acceleration, not creation.**

The geopolitical tensions we see today—the US-China trade war, technology decoupling, the shift to security-focused governance—were **already underway before 2020**. The trade war began in 2018. The Hong Kong National Security Law was enacted in mid-2020, yes, but it reflected strategic trajectories set years earlier. China's revisionist behavior dates to at least 2015. The US pivot to containment began under Trump and continued under Biden.

What COVID did was **accelerate and intensify** these pre-existing trends, not create them.

So where does this leave us?

The statement is **partially valid**. We are indeed experiencing a new phase of globalization, and Hong Kong exemplifies this transformation. The old model of liberal, efficiency-driven, US-led globalization has given way to something more fragmented, security-conscious, and multipolar.

But the statement's timing is **overly simplistic**. This isn't a post-COVID phenomenon. It's the culmination of nearly a decade of structural shifts—in China's global posture, in US foreign policy, in the underlying logic of international economic relations.

The pandemic was an accelerator, not an origin point.

Understanding this matters because if we misdiagnose when and why re-globalization began, we may also misunderstand where it's headed—and how to navigate the complex landscape that lies ahead.

Thank you.

## Speech 5: Alternative View - The Case for Re-globalization Since COVID

---

**[SLIDE: Supporting arguments from presentation_q1_gd.txt]**

Good morning/afternoon. I'm going to present the case **supporting** the original statement—that we are indeed experiencing a new phase of "re-globalization" since COVID-19, with patterns fundamentally different from the past.

While my colleague has offered important qualifications about timing, I want to argue that the **post-COVID period represents a genuine inflection point**—a moment when incremental changes crossed a threshold into something qualitatively new.

Let me support this with evidence from Hong Kong across four dimensions.

**First: Geopolitical Decoupling and Trade Identity.**

In 2020, the US revoked Hong Kong's special trade status. This wasn't just another policy change—it was a **fundamental reclassification** of Hong Kong's identity in the global trading system.

Under the old globalization, Hong Kong operated as a **neutral, semi-automatic hub**. Its trade identity was functional: it facilitated flows between China and the world regardless of political alignment. After 2020, that changed. Hong Kong is now treated as **part of mainland China** for trade and visa purposes. Its identity is now **dictated by geopolitical alignment**, not commercial logic.

This is new. This is post-COVID. And it fundamentally alters how Hong Kong can function in the global economy.

**Second: Supply Chain Fragmentation.**

Look at technology flows. The **export controls on advanced semiconductors** introduced in 2023-2024 explicitly treat Hong Kong as part of mainland China. Nvidia's H100 chips—the most advanced AI processors—cannot flow through Hong Kong as they once did.

This isn't just about one product. It's about the **splitting of technology ecosystems**. Hong Kong can no longer access the same "global" tech stack as the West. It's being forced into a separate technological sphere—a hallmark of the new, fragmented globalization.

Or consider the **De Minimis Reform** of 2024—the "小額豁免改革"—which directly impacts Hong Kong's role in e-commerce by eliminating the duty-free threshold for low-value shipments to the US. This regulatory change from Washington fundamentally reshapes Hong Kong's functionality in global supply chains.

**Third: Institutional Parallelism.**

The establishment of the **International Organization for Mediation** in Wan Chai—the 國際調解院—is a post-COVID phenomenon. Its founding members are primarily from Belt and Road countries. This is a clear example of **institutional parallelism**: creating legal dispute resolution mechanisms separate from Western-dominated courts.

Similarly, the push for **physical gold storage** and **Bitcoin ETFs** in Hong Kong isn't about liberal finance—it's about **risk management**. These assets provide a backdoor to global liquidity that's harder for the West to freeze or sanction compared to USD reserves. The **mBridge project**, developing digital currency platforms with UAE and Thailand to bypass dollar-based systems, has accelerated dramatically in the post-COVID period.

**Fourth: US Foreign Policy Shift.**

The transition from Biden to a potential second Trump administration signals something profound: the **erasure of the "grey area"** that allowed the old model to function.

Previously, Hong Kong occupied ambiguous space—distinct from mainland China, treated as a special case by the US. This ambiguity was functional. It allowed Hong Kong to serve as a bridge.

Post-COVID, the US has systematically **eliminated this ambiguity**. Treating Hong Kong like any other Chinese city in tariffs and visas means the grey area is gone. Hong Kong is now a **frontline in a zero-sum geopolitical contest**, not a neutral facilitator.

**So what's my conclusion?**

The above arguments show that Hong Kong's transformation isn't just a local anomaly—it's part of a **global reorientation** with distinct post-COVID characteristics:

- **Security overrides efficiency** in ways qualitatively different from before
- **Supply chains are fragmented by trust**, not optimized for cost
- **Parallel institutions** are challenging Western dominance at unprecedented scale
- **Neutrality is dead; alignment is mandatory**

This supports the statement because it demonstrates that globalization today operates under **different rules and logics** than before COVID-19. The pandemic didn't just accelerate existing trends—it **crossed thresholds** that fundamentally altered the system's operation.

Yes, the foundations were laid earlier. But the **phase change**—the shift from one mode of operation to another—is a post-COVID phenomenon. And Hong Kong stands as Exhibit A for this transformation.

Thank you.
