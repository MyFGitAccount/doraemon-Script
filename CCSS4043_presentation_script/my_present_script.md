    China’s Motivations​

    China’s key objective has been to reduce reliance on the West and expand its long‑term strategic autonomy. [CCSS4043_p...ntation_q1 | PowerPoint]​

    A central driving force is National Rejuvenation (民族復興) — a long‑term ideological and political goal shaping China’s assertive international behavior. [CCSS4043_p...ntation_q1 | PowerPoint]​

    This goal also explains China’s assertive territorial posture, including actions such as the 11‑dash line in the South China Sea, which signal China’s intention to reshape regional order.​

    China’s increasingly assertive diplomatic style — often referred to as Wolf Warrior Diplomacy — reflects rising nationalism and confidence on the global stage, further accelerating geopolitical tensions.​

    The Dual Circulation strategy represents China’s push to strengthen domestic economic resilience while maintaining selective external openness — another structural driver of re‑globalization shifts.​

    U.S. Motivations​

    The U.S. adopted a more confrontational approach through a containment strategy, marked by actions such as the Huawei ban and tightening chip export controls. [CCSS4043_p...ntation_q1 | PowerPoint]​

    Under the MAGA framework, the U.S. prioritized reshoring, job protection, and rebuilding domestic manufacturing, reducing dependence on China.​

    The 2018 tariffs and the start of the U.S.–China trade war signaled a clear departure from liberal free‑trade norms toward a more security‑driven approach. [CCSS4043_p...ntation_q1 | PowerPoint]​

    The U.S. and its allies shifted from a previously “benevolent” stance to a more predatory, interest‑driven alignment, contributing to global geopolitical fragmentation.​

    Overall Shift​

    Together, these motivations reflect a global transition from cost‑efficiency (liberalism) to security and resilience, marking the emergence of a more fragmented and geopolitically charged phase of globalization.​
