Here's Speech 3 rewritten in plain, simple language at about 280 words:

Good morning/afternoon. I want to talk about how China is using Hong Kong as a tool in its competition with the United States.

In the past, Hong Kong was just a neutral bridge between China and the West. Today, it's become something more active—an instrument China uses to build economic strength and reduce reliance on Western-controlled systems.

Let me give you three examples.

**First: Making the yuan a global currency.**

In 2024, Hong Kong's Financial Secretary announced a 100 billion RMB fund to support trade financing. This sounds complicated, but here's what it means: it encourages companies trading with China to use yuan instead of US dollars.

Every time a business chooses yuan over dollars, the US financial system loses a bit of influence. Hong Kong is becoming the main hub where the world can access and use China's currency. This isn't just about finance—it's about China gaining independence from dollar-based systems.

**Second: Building alternative channels.**

Programs like Bond Connect and Stock Connect let foreign investors buy Chinese assets through Hong Kong. On the surface, this looks like normal integration. But look closer—these deals use yuan, settle through Chinese systems, and follow Chinese rules. Investors engage with China on China's terms, not through Western banks.

This is what experts call "institutional parallelism"—creating backup systems that work if the West ever cuts China off.

**Third: This isn't new.**

These plans started long before COVID. China laid the groundwork in the late 2000s. The first Connect programs launched in 2014. The mBridge project—a digital currency system with Thailand and the UAE to bypass the dollar—was already in development before the pandemic.

So what's the bottom line?

China is using Hong Kong to build what we might call a "West-optional" financial system—one that can connect to the West when useful, but can operate alone if needed. Hong Kong isn't a neutral middleman anymore. It's the strategic center of China's challenge to US financial power.

Thank you.
