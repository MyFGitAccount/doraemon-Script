**[SLIDE: "China use HK as pivot against US policy" with RMB Internationalization, Parallel Channels, Pre-Existing Trajectory]**

Good morning/afternoon. My focus today is on perhaps the most strategic dimension of Hong Kong's transformation: **how China is using Hong Kong as a pivot in its competition with the United States**.

If the old Hong Kong was a passive bridge connecting two systems, the new Hong Kong is an **active instrument** in China's strategy to build economic resilience and reduce dependence on Western-dominated institutions.

Let me walk you through three key dimensions of this pivot.

**First: RMB Internationalization.**

In his 2024 budget speech, Hong Kong's Financial Secretary announced a **100 billion RMB Trade Financing Liquidity Facility**. This might sound like technical financial jargon, but its implications are profound.

This facility provides yuan liquidity to Hong Kong and foreign companies conducting trade with mainland China. The message is clear: **conduct your trade in renminbi, not dollars**. Every transaction that shifts from USD to RMB reduces the reach of the US financial system and the effectiveness of potential sanctions.

Hong Kong is being positioned as the **global offshore RMB hub**—the primary venue where international actors can access, hold, and use China's currency. This isn't just about financial efficiency; it's about **strategic autonomy**.

**Second: Building Parallel Channels.**

Programs like **Bond Connect** and **Stock Connect** allow international investors to access China's financial markets through Hong Kong. On the surface, this looks like integration. But look deeper, and you see something else: these are **financing channels that operate outside the dollar-based system**.

When a foreign investor buys Chinese bonds through Bond Connect, they're participating in a market denominated in renminbi, settled through Chinese infrastructure, governed by Chinese rules. They're engaging with China on China's terms, not through Western intermediaries.

This is what scholars call **institutional parallelism**—building alternative institutions that can function if access to Western-dominated ones is restricted.

**Third—and this is crucial—this trajectory pre-exists the pandemic.**

These initiatives aren't emergency responses to COVID or ad hoc reactions to recent tensions. They're part of a **long-term strategic vision** that Beijing has pursued for years.

The groundwork for RMB internationalization was laid in the late 2000s. The first Connect programs launched in 2014. The **mBridge project**—developing a digital currency platform with Thailand, UAE, and other partners to bypass dollar-based systems—has been in development since before the pandemic.

What we're seeing now is the **deepening and acceleration** of this trajectory, not its creation.

So what does this mean for understanding re-globalization?

It means that Hong Kong's transformation isn't just about politics or governance—it's about **fundamentally restructuring the financial architecture of globalization**. China is using Hong Kong to build what we might call a **"West-optional" financial system**—one that can connect to the West when advantageous, but can function independently when necessary.

This is the new pattern of globalization: not seamless integration under Western rules, but the emergence of **parallel systems** with their own rules, their own currencies, and their own institutions.

And Hong Kong sits at the center of this transformation—not as a neutral middleman, but as the strategic pivot for China's challenge to US financial dominance.

Thank you.
