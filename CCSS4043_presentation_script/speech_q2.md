## Speech 1: Export Controls Create Immediate, Severe Supply Chain Bottlenecks

---

**[SLIDE: "Export Controls Create Immediate, Severe Supply Chain Bottlenecks"]**

Good morning/afternoon everyone. I'm going to start by addressing the most immediate and visible consequence of rare earth export controls: **severe supply chain disruptions** that ripple through multiple industries simultaneously.

When China restricts exports of rare earth elements, it's not like running low on paper clips or plastic components. These materials are **fundamental enablers** of modern manufacturing. Let me show you what happens across three critical sectors.

**First: The Automotive Industry.**

Research by Schmid in 2020 highlighted how shortages of rare earth elements directly challenge the European vehicle industry. But let me make this concrete with a real-world scenario.

Think about **Dysprosium and Terbium**. These elements are essential for manufacturing magnets that can withstand high temperatures—precisely the kind found in electric vehicle motors and regenerative braking systems.

During supply crunches, companies like **Ford or Volkswagen** face a nightmare scenario. They can produce nearly finished vehicles—bodies assembled, interiors installed, wheels attached—but they're missing a single component: an electric power steering motor or a regenerative braking sensor that requires these specific rare earths.

What happens next? These **nearly complete vehicles sit in parking lots**, sometimes for months, waiting for one part. Billions of dollars in **dead capital** are tied up in inventory that can't be sold. Meanwhile, dealerships have empty lots, and consumers face skyrocketing car prices due to artificial scarcity.

This isn't theoretical—it's the reality of modern supply chain vulnerability.

**Second: Renewable Energy.**

Now look at the green transition. **Neodymium** is essential for the permanent magnets in offshore wind turbines. Companies like **Siemens Gamesa and Vestas** have reported major delays in wind farm projects because of rare earth shortages.

Here's the critical point: a single offshore wind turbine requires **hundreds of kilograms** of rare earths. When supply is restricted, it doesn't just slow down one factory—it **halts national-scale infrastructure projects**.

The consequences cascade. Governments miss their carbon-neutral targets. Energy companies face massive contractual penalties for late delivery. And the global transition to green energy slows down precisely when it needs to accelerate.

**Third: The Healthcare Sector.**

This is where the human cost becomes impossible to ignore. **MRI machines**—those massive diagnostic tools that hospitals rely on—depend on superconducting magnets that require specialized rare earth elements.

When export controls disrupt supply, it delays the manufacturing of new scanners. Even worse, it affects **maintenance of existing machines** in hospitals. Replacement parts become scarce.

The result? **Longer wait times for critical diagnostic procedures**. Patients in the US and Europe waiting for cancer diagnoses or neurological scans face delays that can literally be life-threatening. Trade policy directly impacts public health.

**So what's the conclusion here?**

Trade protectionism isn't an abstract economic concept—it creates **immediate, tangible bottlenecks**. When you restrict materials that are embedded in virtually every advanced technology, you don't just inconvenience manufacturers. You stop production lines, you delay infrastructure projects, and you compromise healthcare delivery.

The supply chain is not a magic black box. It's a delicate, interconnected system. And when you create a bottleneck at the source, everything downstream grinds to a halt.

Thank you.

## Speech 2: Limiting Supply Triggers Price Spikes, Passing Costs to Consumers

---

**[SLIDE: "Limiting Supply Triggers Price Spikes, Passing Costs to Consumers"]**

Good morning/afternoon. My focus today is on the **economic ripple effects** of rare earth export controls—specifically, how restricting supply doesn't just create shortages, but triggers **price spikes that ultimately hit consumers' wallets**.

Let me walk you through five examples that show how this works across different sectors.

**First: Electric Vehicles.**

High-performance EV motors rely on **Neodymium and Dysprosium** for permanent magnets. When rare earth prices spike—and Kimball's 2025 analysis shows they do—the manufacturing cost of a single EV motor can increase by **$500 to $1,000**.

Now, Goldman Sachs has noted that mineral price volatility is a primary barrier to making EVs affordable for the middle class. When costs rise, companies like **Tesla or Rivian** face a choice: absorb the cost and hurt their margins, or raise vehicle prices.

They raise prices. This creates what economists call a **"Green Premium"** —an extra cost for choosing environmentally friendly options. And that premium slows global carbon reduction efforts because consumers simply cannot afford to switch from gasoline cars.

**Second: Home Appliances.**

This one affects every household. To meet modern energy-saving standards, air conditioners, refrigerators, and washing machines use high-efficiency compressors powered by rare earth magnets.

In a supply crunch, manufacturers face two bad choices: raise prices by **10 to 15 percent** to cover material costs, or switch back to cheaper, bulkier induction motors that use less rare earths.

If they switch to cheaper motors, here's the hidden consequence: the products become **less energy-efficient**. That means higher monthly electricity bills for households. It's a **long-term hidden tax** on consumers that never appears on a receipt but shows up on every utility bill.

**Third: Smartphones.**

A smartphone only contains a few grams of rare earths—so surely this isn't a big deal, right? Wrong. It's the **complexity of the supply chain** that matters.

Suppliers of vibration motors and high-end speakers—think of companies supplying **Apple or Samsung**—often add a **"Supply Chain Risk Surcharge"** to their invoices during trade tensions.

Here's the multiplier effect: even if the raw material cost only rises by $2, the final retail price of the phone may increase by **$30 to $50**. Why? Because every layer of the supply chain adds a markup to protect against future price volatility. The cost compounds as it moves through each step of production.

**Fourth: Medical Technology.**

Remember those MRI machines I mentioned earlier? They require **Gadolinium and Terbium** to maintain stable magnetic fields. Companies like **GE Healthcare and Siemens Healthineers** produce these scanners, and they require massive amounts of rare earths.

When prices spike, hospitals face **massive surcharges** for new equipment and replacement parts. And hospitals don't just absorb these costs—they pass them on. The cost of diagnostic scans increases, which impacts insurance premiums and patient out-of-pocket costs. Healthcare becomes more expensive for everyone.

**Fifth: Agriculture.**

This might surprise you, but modern farming is highly digitized. Farmers use sensors and GPS-guided automated tractors to maximize crop yields. These systems require specialized magnetic components.

When component costs increase by **40 percent**, agricultural tech companies like **John Deere** raise equipment and maintenance fees. Farmers pass these higher operational costs down to the grocery store.

So here's the irony: a trade war over minerals in the tech sector can lead to **higher bread and produce prices**. Your grocery bill goes up because of export controls on materials you've never heard of.

**The conclusion is clear.**

Limiting supply of rare earth metals triggers rapid price spikes. These increased manufacturing costs don't disappear—they're **ultimately passed to consumers** through higher prices for cars, appliances, phones, healthcare, and even food.

As Gyllensten and colleagues noted in 2016, and J.P. Morgan confirmed in 2026, these costs compound and cascade through the economy. Trade protectionism isn't a free lunch—someone always pays, and that someone is us.

Thank you.

## Speech 3: Protectionism Backfires on Both the Initiator and the Target

---

**[SLIDE: "Protectionism Backfires on Both the Initiator and the Target"]**

Good morning/afternoon. I'm going to address perhaps the most counterintuitive aspect of trade protectionism: **it hurts the country that initiates it just as much as the target**. This is a classic lose-lose scenario, and the rare earth tensions illustrate it perfectly.

Let me break this down into three dimensions: the US side, the China side, and the global financial impact.

**First: The US Side — Imported Inflation and Manufacturing Hollowing.**

When the US imposes retaliatory tariffs on Chinese goods—say, 100 percent tariffs in response to rare earth curbs—it creates a **self-inflicted wound** for American industry.

Consider companies like **Caterpillar or John Deere**. These American manufacturers rely on Chinese-made intermediate components—specialized sensors, small motors, electronic components. These aren't finished products; they're parts that go into American-made equipment.

When the US imposes tariffs on these components, here's what happens: American manufacturers must either absorb the cost—which hurts their stock price and competitiveness—or raise prices, which makes them less competitive against European or Japanese rivals who aren't facing the same tariffs.

As Quiroz-Gutierrez reported in Fortune in 2025, tariff instability is hitting American companies hard. The intended punishment of China becomes **punishment of American industry and American consumers**. This is imported inflation—inflation caused not by domestic factors, but by trade policy.

**Second: The China Side — The Reliability Discount and Capital Flight.**

Now look at China's position. By using rare earths as a geopolitical lever, China risks its long-term status as the "World's Factory."

Following the 2025 tensions, European giants like **Siemens and Schneider Electric** accelerated their **"China Plus One" strategies**. They shifted critical production lines to Vietnam, India, and Mexico—not because of labor costs, but to escape what they perceive as **supply chain blackmail**.

When international investors view a market as unpredictable, they pull capital out. This leads to a permanent loss of Foreign Direct Investment—FDI. As Z2Data noted in their 2026 analysis of critical minerals, this represents a fundamental shift. It's not just about this year's profits; it's about **long-term structural change** in global supply chains.

China's short-term leverage accelerates Western investment in alternatives: rare earth recycling, magnet-free motors, new suppliers in Australia and the US. This permanently erodes China's market dominance. The aggressive trade policy backfires on the initiator.

**Third: Financial Market Volatility.**

This is the dimension that affects everyone. Trade wars create a climate of **uncertainty that freezes investment**.

Whenever new export controls or tariffs are announced, tech-heavy indices like the **NASDAQ and the CSI 300** experience sharp sell-offs. Companies like **NVIDIA or Tesla** may delay building new factories because they cannot predict the cost of raw materials six months from now.

Edwards reported in Fortune in February 2026 that this "Sell America" trade has inflicted lasting damage. What we see is the creation of **"dead capital"** —billions of dollars sitting on the sidelines instead of being invested in innovation and expansion. This lowers long-term GDP growth potential for both nations.

**So here's the comprehensive picture.**

The US suffers inflation and weakened industry. China loses credibility, investment, and long-term market power. Global financial markets become more volatile. And consumers worldwide bear the costs through higher prices and slower economic growth.

Each example demonstrates that protectionist measures—whether tariffs or export controls—create **mutually destructive outcomes**. This isn't a game where one side wins and the other loses. It's a cycle of retaliation that ensures nobody wins and everyone pays the price.

As the J.P. Morgan analysis from 2026 asks: what's the impact? The answer is clear: negative for everyone.

Thank you.

## Speech 4: Trade Wars Sabotage the Green Transition and Weaken Defense

---

**[SLIDE: "Trade Wars Sabotage the Green Transition and Weaken Defense"]**

Good morning/afternoon. I want to address two areas where trade protectionism has consequences that extend far beyond economics: **our ability to combat climate change and our collective security**. These are the costs that don't show up in GDP figures but affect our future and our safety.

**First: The Green Transition Stalemate.**

Rare earths are not optional for green technology—they're **fundamental**. Wind turbines, electric vehicle motors, and energy-efficient appliances all depend on these materials.

When China restricts exports, the cost of clean energy increases. As Zheng noted in a 2024 analysis, trade tensions directly impact our ability to achieve carbon neutrality. Let me give you a concrete example.

Because China dominates rare earth processing, many of the most efficient and low-cost separation techniques are **patented or held as trade secrets in China**. This isn't just about mining—it's about the entire processing chain.

If the US and its allies cut off ties, or if China restricts exports, Western companies are forced to build processing plants **from scratch**. They cannot use the best Chinese-developed technology. This leads to **duplication of effort** and reinventing the wheel.

Here's the tragedy: capital that could have been spent on innovating the next generation of battery technology or advancing renewable energy systems is instead wasted on **rebuilding existing 20th-century processing capacity**. Global technological advancement slows down for everyone.

Look at electric vehicles. Rare earths—specifically Neodymium—are used in the high-performance magnets inside EV motors. When supply is restricted, global EV manufacturers like **Tesla and Volkswagen** face shortages. They must either pay exorbitant prices on the black market or rush to redesign motors that use fewer rare earths—which can reduce performance.

If the US imposes tariffs in response, the cost of every EV increases. Consumers in the US and Europe face higher prices, slowing adoption. This hurts the climate. It also potentially hurts Chinese EV makers like **BYD** if they face retaliatory tariffs or a global economic slowdown. The consumer pays more, and the planet gets hotter.

**Second: Defense Vulnerabilities.**

This is where trade protectionism intersects with national security in the most direct way possible.

The **F-35 fighter jet**—a joint project between the US and its allies including the UK, Italy, and others—relies on rare earth magnets for its systems. These aren't optional components; they're integral to the aircraft's performance.

Now consider what happens if China cuts off supply. The US cannot simply "flip a switch" and produce rare earths domestically. It takes **years to build mines and refineries**. As Baskaran noted in a CSIS analysis from October 2025, China's rare earth and magnet restrictions directly threaten US defense supply chains.

The result? The US stalls the production line of F-35s. Allies like Italy don't get their planes. This **weakens the collective defense of the entire alliance**.

But here's the longer-term consequence that China must consider. If China weaponizes these minerals, it **destroys trust**. Other nations will desperately fund any alternative source—Australia, Canada, Africa—to bypass China. This permanently reduces China's future market share and geopolitical leverage. In the long run, China loses its best customer.

**The paradox is stark.**

China might seem to "win" by controlling the supply, but higher global prices reduce overall demand for green tech, slowing the global transition. This harms everyone, including China, through accelerated climate change.

The US "loses" because its renewable energy projects become more expensive and delayed, and its defense supply chains become vulnerable.

And the global alliance structure—the foundation of post-World War II security—becomes strained when member states can't get the equipment they need.

As Nassar and colleagues noted in their 2024 USGS analysis, export restrictions have quantifiable effects on the economy. But the effects on climate and security are harder to quantify but no less real.

Trade protectionism doesn't just shift costs—it **undermines our collective future**.

Thank you.

## Speech 5: Conclusion — Trade Protectionism is a Zero-Sum Game with Negative Outcomes

---

**[SLIDE: "Trade Protectionism is a Zero-Sum Game with Negative Outcomes"]**

Good morning/afternoon. I've been asked to bring together all these threads and offer a **final conclusion** on the statement: "Under the context of the recent tensions over rare earth materials between China and the United States, nobody can win from export control."

After examining the evidence across multiple sectors and dimensions, I can say this: **the statement is not just valid—it's an understatement**.

Let me summarize what we've learned.

**First: Export controls create immediate, severe supply chain bottlenecks.**

We saw this in automotive manufacturing, where nearly complete vehicles sit in parking lots waiting for single magnet-dependent components. We saw it in renewable energy, where offshore wind farm projects face delays that undermine climate targets. And we saw it in healthcare, where MRI machine maintenance and manufacturing disruptions lead to longer patient wait times.

The supply chain is not a resilient, adaptable system when it comes to rare earths. These materials are **fundamental inputs** with no easy substitutes. Restrict them at the source, and everything downstream grinds to a halt.

**Second: Limiting supply triggers price spikes that pass costs to consumers.**

From electric vehicles facing $500 to $1,000 cost increases per motor, to household appliances becoming either more expensive or less efficient, to smartphones with hidden supply chain surcharges, to healthcare costs rising, to grocery prices increasing—the pattern is consistent.

When you restrict supply of fundamental materials, **consumers ultimately pay**. The costs compound at every stage of the supply chain and emerge as higher prices for everything from cars to bread.

**Third: Protectionism backfires on both the initiator and the target.**

The US suffers from **imported inflation** and weakened manufacturing competitiveness. Companies like Caterpillar and John Deere face higher costs for components, making them less competitive globally.

China suffers from a **reliability discount**. When international investors and manufacturers view China as an unpredictable supplier, they accelerate "China Plus One" strategies, shifting production to Vietnam, India, and Mexico. This permanently reduces foreign direct investment and erodes China's long-term market dominance.

Both nations suffer from **financial market volatility** that freezes investment and creates dead capital—money sitting on the sidelines instead of funding innovation and growth.

**Fourth: Trade wars sabotage the green transition and weaken defense.**

The global fight against climate change slows when clean energy technologies become more expensive. Duplication of effort—Western nations rebuilding processing capacity that already exists in China—wastes capital that could have advanced next-generation green technology.

And defense supply chains become vulnerable. The F-35 program and other critical defense systems face delays, weakening collective security alliances. When China weaponizes minerals, it destroys trust and accelerates Western efforts to find alternative sources—permanently reducing China's own market share.

**So what's our final conclusion?**

Trade protectionism in the context of rare earth materials is a **zero-sum game with negative outcomes for everyone involved**.

Export controls and tariffs create a lose-lose scenario: the US suffers from inflation and industrial weakness, while China loses credibility and long-term market dominance. Neither achieves its strategic objectives.

The **global fallout** extends far beyond the two primary actors. Manufacturers worldwide face increased costs and uncertainty. Consumers everywhere pay higher prices for essential goods. Critical advancements in green energy and healthcare face delays. And collective defense capabilities are compromised.

The statement we're evaluating says "nobody can win from the export control." Our evidence suggests something stronger: **everyone loses**.

The European auto industry faces challenges, as Schmid documented. Offshore wind projects face delays, as Fishman and Graedel found. Healthcare innovation faces a hidden crisis, as Rare Earth Exchanges reported. US manufacturers face competitive disadvantages, as Quiroz-Gutierrez showed. Chinese investment faces long-term erosion, as Z2Data analyzed.

In the rare earth tensions between China and the United States, there are no winners. There are only varying degrees of loss. And the bill ultimately comes due for all of us—at the dealership, at the grocery store, at the hospital, and in the increasingly urgent fight against climate change.

Trade protectionism promises to protect domestic interests. But when the global economy is as interconnected as ours, **protectionism is just a tax on everyone, collected by everyone, paid by everyone**.

Thank you.
