                <div class="dialogue">Because it is Ramadan. Well, it was. It ended last week. But… the spirit remains. It is about self-discipline, sacrifice, and empathy for those who suffer. For thirty days, we abstain to draw closer to God, to purify ourselves, to remember the needy. Now… look outside. All of Japan is needy. All are suffering. If the ultimate act of <strong>Ramadan</strong> is to give of oneself completely to alleviate suffering, in obedience to God's will… then perhaps this is my test. A final, terrible sadaqah.</div>

                <div class="dialogue">That is a noble impulse, Kanji. But is it wisdom? Or is it fear speaking, dressed as piety? Let us think, not just feel. In my tradition—the Daoist part of me—we speak of <strong>Chengfu</strong>.</div>

                <div class="dialogue">Yes. But more. It is the burden of one's innate nature, the karma of your very being before you even act. The weight you are born to carry. My Buddhist side would call it vāsanā, the karmic imprints. We three were all born at the same, absurdly specific moment. 1:11 am, January 1st, 2001. Why? What is the <strong>Chengfu</strong> of that moment? What is the collective burden we share, simply by being here, born then?</div>

                <div class="dialogue">You speak of understanding the current. But my faith speaks of a God who is the source of the river itself. And this… this horror of the bears, the slaughter, the collapse… it forces the oldest question to the surface. The one we call the problem of evil.</div>

                <div class="dialogue">Is it? To allow children to be torn apart by bears as a test? That does not sound like love. It sounds like cruelty. And yet… my faith insists: <strong>God is love</strong>. Not just loving, but Love itself. The very essence.</div>

                <div class="character momoko">MOMOKO (CONT'D)</div>
                <div class="dialogue">Love needs freedom to be real. God gave us—and maybe even the bears—true freedom of choice. They chose to leave the forest. They chose violence. If God stepped in to force a different choice, we'd just be puppets. You can't force love on a puppet. That freedom is worth the terrible price of their choice.</div>
                <div class="character yuki">YUKI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">So God values the principle of freedom more than the immediate prevention of suffering?</div>
                <div class="character momoko">MOMOKO</div>
                <div class="dialogue">You're right, it's not indifference. Love doesn't watch from a distance—it enters the suffering, like Christ on the cross. So if I go, it won't be to fulfill a myth or please a god. It will be an act of love. A choice to enter a broken world and share its pain, to save others from it. Not because I have to, but because true love, when faced with evil, chooses sacrifice.</div>

                <div class="character yuki">YUKI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">Your explanation about evil makes sense from a distance. It's about the stage, but not the actors. My view focuses on <strong>Karma</strong>—the action itself. It's about cause and effect. Every action plant a seed. The bears' violence is the fruit of many causes: our invasion of their home, the changing world. Us being here is also a result of past causes. The choice we make now will plant a new seed with huge consequences for the future.</div>

                <div class="character yuki">YUKI (CONT'D)</div>
                <div class="dialogue">The reason why we go matters as much as going itself. If Kanji goes out of fear, that action is rooted in fear. If Momoko goes in loving sacrifice, it may carry a hidden pride. If I go, I must ask: am I trying to truly end the cycle of suffering, or just running from my own? <strong>Karma</strong> is precise. The intention plants the seed.</div>
                <div class="character kanji">KANJI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">So we must not only decide who, but with what mind? That's impossible to purify!</div>

                <div class="dialogue">It is the work of a lifetime. We have two hours. The point is, we must be ruthlessly honest. This is not about earning a reward. In Buddhism, sacrifice for reward is still a transaction, binding you to the cycle. The ultimate goal is to act with such selfless compassion that you break the cycle. For the sake of all beings. Including the bears.</div>
                <div class="character momoko">MOMOKO</div>
                <div class="dialogue">Compassion… for the bears?</div>
                <div class="character yuki">YUKI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">They are suffering too. They are driven by a hunger they do not understand, a search for a mythical ruler. They are trapped in aggression and fear. They are part of the sentient world suffering from ignorance. A Bodhisattva would have compassion for them as well. So the act of going… if done with that ultimate, impartial compassion… could generate immense, liberating merit. Not for me, but for the situation itself.</div>

                <div class="dialogue">I offered to go. But now… your words confuse me. Is my offer true submission, or just a desperate attempt to make sense of the chaos? To force God's hand?</div>
                <div class="character yuki">YUKI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">It is. And it touches on <strong>Chengfu</strong> again. Your innate nature, Kanji, is passionate and devout. That is your burden and your gift. To act against it would be a violence to yourself. To act solely from its fever pitch might be unwise. You must find its still center.</div>

                <div class="dialogue">I have been thinking. About your <strong>God is love</strong>, Momoko. And about submission. In Islam, God is Al-Wadud, the Loving. His will is an expression of that love. My offer… it was not trust. It was a frantic bargain. "Take me so this ends." That is not loving submission. That is terror. I must… I must withdraw my offer.</div>
                <div class="character yuki">YUKI</div>
                <div class="dialogue">And I have been thinking of <strong>Karma</strong>. If I go seeking to be a Bodhisattva, the very seeking plants the seed of ego. The 'I' who will be a hero. The 'I' who will generate merit. It is a trap. True compassion is without a self who is compassionate.</div>
                <div class="character yuki">YUKI (CONT'D)</div>
                <div class="dialogue">You, Momoko. You spoke of love not as a feeling, but as the nature of God. As a person. An act. That… feels less karmically sticky. It is about the nature of the act itself, not its future fruit for the actor.</div>

And if Love has a place in this bear-ridden hell, it is beside the victim, becoming the victim, to stop the victimizing. Not by power, but by solidarity. Even if it looks like a fool in a Doraemon costume.</div>
